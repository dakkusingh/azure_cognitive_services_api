# Azure Cognitive Services API

## [Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/)
Microsoft Face API, a cloud-based service that provides the most advanced face algorithms. Face API has two main functions: face detection with attributes and face recognition.

* Detect human faces and compare similar ones
* Organize images into groups based on similarity
* Identify previously tagged people in images

## [Emotion API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/emotion/home)

The Emotion API beta takes an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, from the Face API. The emotions detected are happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, contempt, disgust or neutral. These emotions are communicated cross-culturally and universally via the same basic facial expressions, where are identified by Emotion API.

### [Recognition](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5639d931ca73072154c1ce89/operations/563b31ea778daf121cc3a5fa)
